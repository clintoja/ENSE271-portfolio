### Lab 1 
This lab was about story boarding. We learned about it on Stories On Board 

Per our Lab Instructor Asignment: 


# Grocery Delivery App:

Using StoriesOnBoard, create a new, private, solo board which represents the User Story Map for an application for getting groceries delivered. Focus primarily on the user side of the application, e.g. less on the drivers or administrators. Perform User Story Mapping to develop a map which captures the most necessary user stories for this application. In accomplishing this, you should have:

    At least three epics in the backbone
    At least six steps in the walking skeleton
    At least 18 total tasks
        All tasks need to have a name, status and time estimate, but the estimates need not be realistic
    At least 3 detailed tasks
        Edit the details for at least three tasks and try out at least three different features available in markdown features
    At least 2 releases, including some unscheduled tasks
    At least 1 extra feature not discussed in lab, such as additional card colors, annotations or personas
    A readme.txt file which explains the following:
        Your general thought process for developing your user story map
        At least three decisions you made when creating the stories in map
            Why you made those decision
            How the results of those decision are captured in the user story map
        What is the extra feature that you tried?

Please note that the map does not need to exhaustively capture every feature of the application.

Running Assignment - Development Portfolio

    Start a new (private for now) GitHub Repo which will be your portfolio for the course
    Upon completing assignments, take screenshots and push them to the repo
    You will add to this repo all semester!
    For this lab, you only need to have a readme.md uploaded, which contains markdown code that explains the purpose of the repoistory.
