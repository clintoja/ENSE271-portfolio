My rationale for creating my app storyboard was trying to make a simple functional app, which in later releases would add 
advance features and later well thought-out AI features that can make life easier for consumers. Features such as sorting 
and comparison are very important for consumers trying to find their products, so my app contains departmnents, searching features,
and tags such as vegan, calorie wise, and gluten free. A good app would also making checking out and delivery as simple as possible which is why
my app would not have too much going on during checkout other than payment, options for recurring periodic delivery, and 
recommended items to add based off of previous purchases. Payment will initally be limited to visa, but options for financing,
paypal, and crypto will come in future releases. Delivery is not complicated starting out with initally only nessecary features,
but in later releases, sophisticated instructions and scheduled delivery will come in. Customer feedback is obviously an important 
feature of a proper app, which is why my app will makes this as easy as possible. Starting with MVP with just a simple feedback textbox,
later on a star rating system will be added, as well as a tags systems. AI features will be added in some of the end stage releases, with two
in my story board. One will have predictive stock features based off of demand and shipping times, making managers jobs easier, and the other AI 
feature will allow a customer to type their order and an AI will turn it into a cart instantly, allowing the ordering time to be completely reduced.

A decision I made was to add AI. I did this because it can add interesting features that will attract and retain customers, and it will do this 
as it makes things very convenient for them and bring delight. People nowadays are also fascinated with AI, and a lot rely on AI applications like 
chapGPT and Gemini. The results of this is there being AI in the board.

Another decision I made was to Keep things relatively simple, as I believe that cluterring an app and having random features do not help sales 
or keep your app's features harmonious. I stuck to keeping things I thought would bring a delightful experience. This result of this is not too many 
random features, and all of the features bringing something to the apps experience as well as there being three backbones.

Another decision I made was to have an epic for the managers as I believe it is important to plan out tasks for them, as management is 
an important part of business for sure. The effect of this was the AI task for managers, and having an epic for them.

The feature I chose to use that was not disussed was card colours. I coloured stories that used AI as blue. Also personas were used.
