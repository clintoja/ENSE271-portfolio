### Lab 6 : Wordpress theme/setup

In this lab, we expanded our knowledge of wordpress with themes and more advanced tools

Assignment, Per Lab Instructor: 

Your assignment is to build a wordpress site with 2 static pages and 3 blog pages, similar in scope to our pre-lab, for an volunteer organization or a web store. This organization should offer at least 3 products or services about which you can make blog pages.

Your site should include:

    A consistent header across pages
    A consistent footer across pages
    Appropriate menu linking the pages, with both mobile and desktop variants
    A landing page with at least 3 sections
        Each section should highlight something about store, e.g. an aspect of their location, staff or culture
        Each section should experiment with a different type of Wordpress block
    A blog page with at least 3 entries
        Each entry should represent a product or service offered by the company
        Be sure to aggregate all of the blog posts in some type of a container
    I’d recommend quickly prototyping in Figma first, but don’t get too frustrated when you can’t exactly replicate your Figma Design
    You may include elements and styling from templates, but obviously cannot simply submit a template! Use it is a starting point to add, modify or adapt, like we did in the lab.
    You can experiment with a different Page Builder if you would like, like Elementor or Beaver Builder, but expect a performance hit!
