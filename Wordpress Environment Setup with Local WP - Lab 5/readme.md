### Lab 5 : WordPress Environment Setup with local WP

This lab was about basic wordpress setup using Local. 

Assignment, per lab instructor: 
You will complete this lab in two steps.

Part 1: Develop a persona for a person who is using an application to buy Tickets for a concert. To complete this you must:

    Consider the types of users who buy tickets for concerts
        What type of concert?
        What age range?
        What is their preferred way of paying, etc.
    Create this persona in figma, either using my persona template or something similar

Part 2: Pretending that you are that Persona which you created, create a personal home page / blog.

    The purpose of this web page is to express elements of that user’s traits and personality in a unique way
    To complete this, you must create a new wordpress site in Local
    (Optional) You may install a different starter template than the one we looked at
        This is optional as you may need to configure a lot of the template to work with your persona, and we won’t look at this in too much depth until next lab!
    Create the framework for the personal website, which should include:
        A home page which captures the most important elements of your persona’s personality
        Three static page, each of which conveys additional details about this persona
            You must use three different blocks on each page. Experiment and see how many you can try. Don’t worry too much on style and looking good at this point, just functionality is fine.
                e.g. If your persona is a concertgoer, what kind of music do they like?
        Make a blog page with three entries
            In each one, comment on a specific need or pain point of the user.
                e.g. when buying concert tickets in the past, what thinks have caused them grief? Tell me a little story about it!
                It does not need to be lengthy.
    Link the website together using appropriate naviation structures. Use the following heirarchy:

- Home page
  - Static page 1
  - Static page 2
  - Static page 3
  - Blog page
    - Blog post 1
    - Blog post 2
    - Blog post 3

    Document your site with screen-shots, one for the home page, one for each static page, one for the blog page, and one for each blog post
